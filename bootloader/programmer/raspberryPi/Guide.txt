Copy to openocd.cfg and samd21_sam_ba.bin to your pi "/home/pi" folder
***Both files need to be in the same folder***.

Open putty/telnet client and log into the pi

Type this commands (without quotes):

"ls"

You should see opencd.cfg & sam21.sam_ba.bin in the directory, if not type this (without quotes):

"cd ~"
"cd /home/pi"

If you don't see the files now, you never put them in the correct folder.

Next type (without quotes):

"sudo openocd"

You should get some info in your telnet/putty screen showing you this:

adapter speed: 400 kHz
cortex_m reset_config sysresetreq
none separate
BCM2835 GPIO nums: swclk = 25, swdio = 24
BCM2835 GPIO config: srst = 18
adapter_nsrst_delay: 100
adapter_nsrst_assert_width: 100
Info : BCM2835 GPIO JTAG/SWD bitbang driver
Info : SWD only mode enabled (specify tck, tms, tdi and tdo gpios to add JTAG mode)
Info : clock speed 400 kHz
Info : SWD DPIDR 0x00736cb8

Press ctrl+c to exit from the program

Now go and edit opencd.cfg

Change this:
#at91samd bootloader 0

#program samd21_sam_ba.bin verify

#at91samd bootloader 8192

#reset

#shutdown

To this:
at91samd bootloader 0

program samd21_sam_ba.bin verify

at91samd bootloader 8192

reset

shutdown


Now we should be able to program the chip, Enter the command (without quotes)

"sudo openocd"

If everything went correctly - that should be the bootloader programmed.
